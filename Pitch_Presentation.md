## Overview

There were at least 111 civil wars and conflicts from 1944 to 1999, and that number has only risen since. Of those 111 conflicts 61 of them implemented power-sharing agreements and many of them failed, resulting in the resumption of civil war. Why are these agreements so promenent if they are so prone to failure?

Power-Sharing Agreements: Developed by Arend Lijphart and consist of:

- Grand coalition

- Proportional representation

- Mutual veto

- Segmental autonomy

## Methodolgy

Many of these agreements fail and previous studies have been done espousing that the type of agreement had the highest effect on the duration and success. Little has been done regarding the national level economics of the countries in which these agreements are implemented. That is where this analysis comes in. 

I have created a dataset of every power-shairng agreement from 1989 to 2018 and have averaged each agreement country's various economic stats from the World Bank for the years the agreement was enacted. The app I have created allows the user to look at each of these variables against the duration of the agreement to see the effects of economics on Power-Sharing.

## Analysis

What can be seen in the preliminary assesements on the previous slides is that many of these agreements fail far more than they succeed and economics do play a role in the duration of the agreement. The default indicator of success based on prior studies is that the country did not resume violence after 5 years of the enactment of the agreement. The graph on the previous slide shows that the higher the average household income of the citizens of a country the longer the agreement will last; some for longer than 20 years!

The app will allow the user to test all variables in the data set including those that were used in previous studies to see how they "stack up" against the national economic variables. This interactive enviroment will get people thinking more about international relations, peace treaties, economics and how they all tie together. It may even inspire some to take up degrees in International Relations, Diplomacy, or Public Administration!

## Conclusion

The field of International Relations is as diverse as the world which it studies and there are many perspectives to apply to the same problem. This app shows that Peacemaking is not one-dimensional and cannot be solved by just signing a document between countries. The more we explore this data the better we become at truly creating peace, or at least civility, between nations.
