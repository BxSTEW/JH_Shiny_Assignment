Overview
========================================================

Power-Sharing Agreements: Developed by Arend Lijphart and consist of
- Grand coalition, 
- Proportional representation, 
- Mutual veto, 
- Segmental autonomy

There were at least 111 civil wars and conflicts from 1944 to 1999, and that number has only risen since. Of those 111 conflicts 61 of them implemented power-sharing agreements.

Methodology
========================================================
Many of these agreements fail and previous studies have been done espousing that the type of agreement had the highest effect on the duration and success. Little has been done regarding the national level economics of the countries in which these agreements are implemented. That is where this analysis comes in. 

I have created a dataset of every power-shairng agreement from 1989 to 2018 and have averaged each agreement country's various economic stats from the World Bank for the years the agreement was enacted. The app I have created allows the user to look at each of these variables against the duration of the agreement to see the effects of economics on Power-Sharing.
